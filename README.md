## Details

Gradio and stremalit apps to run a basic RAG over a given text. In this case I used LOTR because I know the text enough to ask interesting questions and determine errors etc. 

I ran this as an experiment to see how different types of embedding models or generative models differ in their ability to chat over a closed corpus. 

The learnings are that even small, 3B or smaller models tend to do well in simple queries, and even large models mess up when the queries are complex.

My approach in subsequent projects has been to focus heavily on good retrieval, because that matters more than the sophistication of the language model in most cases.
